# Movie Recommendation Flask App

## Project Objective 
This repo can be used to produce a simple movie recommendation web app. The app is written with `Python 3.7`.


## Goal
Build a movie recommender system to suggest movies for users. Users can get better experience if they can be recommended with good movies, and thus the website can maintain, and even expand its popularity. 

* Mission: Create an interactive web app that is based on movie contents to provide good movie suggestions to the web users


## Data
The raw data is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/data).

## Nota Bene

Due to memory constraint with Heroku (512MB by website), I couldn't put all the database. Therefore it's possible than my model doesn't recognize some well known movies.
